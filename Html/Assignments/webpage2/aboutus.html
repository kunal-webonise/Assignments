Home sellers view contingent-sale offers with caution
Some sellers won't even consider a contingent-sale offer. If the buyer's house doesn't sell, the deal if off and the seller has to find another buyer. To increase your chance of success if you make an offer contingent on the sale of your home, it helps to look at your offer from the seller's perspective.
